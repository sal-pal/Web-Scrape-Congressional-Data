This script collected the data for my senior thesis, where I sought to measure the productivity of the Senate by observing all the working relationships occurring between each senator. A working relationship is defined as whether two senators sponsored the same bill together.

My script collected the data from the Library of Congress website, and made associative pairs between each senator that sponsored the same bill. This associative pair, represented via tupples, was then saved into a csv file.
